<body><h1>Glow-worm &#x2013; P.5</h1><p>Subject: Your Nilles University Application August 21st, Y1 Dear Applicant (Point_Me_@_The_Sky@mail)</p><p>We regret to inform you that your application for graduate study in our department was turned down. We look at each application and applicant as a whole and decisions are based on a composite of information including your previous academic performance, referrals, relevant professional activities, proposed research statements, and test scores.</p><p>Due to a high volume of applicants, this message has been partially automated. Your application was received by paper and email and discussed by me and one other faculty member. We responded by email as per your preference. We would like to stress, for your particular application: â€¢ That we would very much like you to apply again in future years. â€¢ That we would encourage you to use the same email address, as we can easily tie it back to this application. â€¢ We felt your academics were very strong. â€¢ We felt your extracurriculars were exceptional. â€¢ We felt your references were exceptional. â€¢ In a time when records are often lacking and references may be hard to identify or contact, your application stood above and beyond in how complete and thorough it was.</p><p>Nilles is one of three Universities serving an estimated population of fifty million on Earth Gimel and its associated territories, and it is the sole post-secondary institution offering graduate studies. Over one and a half million bright and eager minds have applied to Nilles in avid hope of starting or resuming their educations, and regretfully, with our current facilities, we cannot accept more than twenty thousand.</p><p>Although these circumstances mean we must regretfully send you an unfavorable response, we appreciate your application. We wish you the best in your future endeavors and look forward to hearing from you next year.</p><p>Yours truly, Dr. Marilyn Ginbar Graduate Advisor</p><p>â– </p><p>â™¦ Private Messages from Glitzglam:</p><p>Glitzglam: Friend said emails out today Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I got mine this morning.
