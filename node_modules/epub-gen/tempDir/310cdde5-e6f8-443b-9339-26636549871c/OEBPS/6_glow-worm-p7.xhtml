You said you were feeling down in Pillowfort last night.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: i’m better Heart_Shaped_Pupil: i’m ready to start the day. i’m excited at the idea of getting info.</p><p>Thistlesoup: That’s good to hear. 🙂 Milldross: You wanted us to nag you about your punctuation and capitals. Your friend got irritated about it. Flying_Kevin: this is the girl that was the Ward, right? Flying_Kevin: I’m new btw</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I did. Thank you mill. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I did. I just woke up. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I am. Hi Kevin.

Kenzie M?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: That me. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’m not supposed to be sharing out my name and tying it to this account but I figure in this context it’s okay. You’ve seen my face, you know my name, you know my powers, I trust you.</p><p>AvenG: Yeah.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I don’t want to be a pest. I just wanted to say hi and say I’m glad you’re alive. I always thought you were cool. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: and if you ever want to talk or meet or whatever, you know where I’m at and you can send me a message.</p><p>AvenG: Ok. AvenG: No offense, but I probably won’t.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: ok.</p><p>AvenG: Sorry. I’m trying to get a fresh start, the Wards were pretty good times but that was then. You and I didn’t talk then, with the age difference, so it’s strange to talk now.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It’s okay. You were frontline and I was backline. You were a teenager, I was the brat. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: There are lots of reasons I’m sure but ‘no’ is the only one that matters. I wish you the best. 🙂</p><p>AvenG: thank you. Good luck with whatever you end up doing, Kenzie.</p><p>■</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: /back</p><p>You have marked yourself as back Welcome back to the Treefort_Lookout!</p><p>Tockta: How did it go?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Not great.

Houndstooth: I’m in the middle of a conversation with Ave. She said you reached out.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’m keeping an eye out for my old teammates. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’m glad you’re alive, houndstooth.</p><p>Houndstooth: I’m glad you’re alive too, Kenzie. Houndstooth: What are you up to these days?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’m looking at joining a team. Kind of. We’re still figuring a lot out. It’s exciting. they’re neat.</p><p>Houndstooth: That’s really good to hear Houndstooth: I’ve talked to some of the others offline. We made out better than most. The only question mark is 10-59, but I’m suspicious they’re okay.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I already found them. they’re alive and well.</p><p>Houndstooth: Did you? ok. good. great. Then we only lost Pigeonhole, but you knew about them. We made out better than most.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: it’s great. I’m so relieved. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I really liked the team. Everyone was so cool. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It was an important time for me. Coming back to Baltimore to join the team was the first time I got to stop and settle down.</p><p>Houndstooth: Yeah</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It was home Heart_Shaped_Pupil: so it means alot to me to hear you say **we** when talking about us making it out mostly okay.</p><p>Houndstooth: You know that was then, don’t you? Houndstooth: Back in the past. Things have changed.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: uh huh</p><p>Houndstooth: You got a bad deal, Kenzie. Not the worst I’ve seen but I’ve seen a lot of people get better hands than what you got. You tried as hard as anyone and you did really good work. Houndstooth: You were a better hero when you were four and a half feet tall than some adult capes I know today</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’ve heard this speech before H.T. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: variants of it Heart_Shaped_Pupil: you gave me a version of it once Heart_Shaped_Pupil: you don’t have to let me down easy. I’m tough. 🙂 Heart_Shaped_Pupil: just cut to the chase. 😉</p><p>Houndstooth: I think you shouldn’t contact the others. Houndstooth: They have their own things to work through. They’re rebuilding. Everyone’s looking forward. Houndstooth: You have a new team. That’s great.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: huh. was i really that bad?</p><p>Houndstooth: You weren’t bad okay? Houndstooth: You weren’t bad.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: but?</p><p>Houndstooth: But… Houndstooth: give me a second to type.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: HT… i was ten Heart_Shaped_Pupil: iv’e grown up some Heart_Shaped_Pupil: i was there for the end of the world Heart_Shaped_Pupil: i did stuff. i actually really helped</p><p>Houndstooth: Absolutely Houndstooth: I keep typing responses and deleting them Houndstooth: People are gunshy</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: gunshy? Heart_Shaped_Pupil: of me?</p><p>Houndstooth: Shit. Now I feel bad.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Don’t Heart_Shaped_Pupil: i’m disappointed is all</p><p>Houndstooth: I can’t stress enough that I have a lot of respect for you.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: thank you 🙂 Heart_Shaped_Pupil: can you give me one shot then? Heart_Shaped_Pupil: not even as friends. it can be business. I’m useful. you’ve been prasing my work ethic. I’m smart. I have a kind of team. If you do me the favor of giving me a shot I can do you one favor for free.</p><p>Houndstooth: I don’t know</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: you’re a smart guy and you were a good leader. you know how these things work. you know my power has its uses. others would kidnap me for it. I am offering myself to you and you would be stupid to turn me down. use me. please. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: if you respect me so much then let me prove myself</p><p>Houndstooth: Okay.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Yes?</p><p>Houndstooth: Sure. Absolutely. Houndstooth: I can contact you here?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: yes</p><p>Houndstooth: I will be in touch.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: ok</p><p>Houndstooth: I will also talk to the others. I will leave your contact info with them. If they are comfortable with it they can reach out to you.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: got it Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’ll cross my fingers.</p><p>Houndstooth: I have to run.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: thanks for making the time to talk to me</p><p>Houndstooth: Keep up the good work.

I’m choosing to view this in a positive light. My day has to get better from here.</p><p>Tockta: That’s positive.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It is! Heart_Shaped_Pupil: For now I need a distraction. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Any other news?</p><p>Maxtag: Tattletale took on a new mission that’s taking her to Earth N. She’ll be busy for a short while.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: ! Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Why didn’t you tell me sooner? Priorities!</p><p>Maxtag: I didn’t know it was important.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It is. Information about my new teammates is key.

I’m Graham. I’m with the PHO IT team. You can call me by my name or just ‘shower’.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Hi Shower. What can I do for you?</p><p>Shower: We had some unusual search activity that seemed to be causing congestion. Would you happen to know anything about this?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I might. It would have been during off-peak hours though.</p><p>Shower: We update infrastructure during off-peak hours. it slowed us down. It stalled us for three hours last night.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: oh that’s not good.</p><p>Shower: You’re piggybacking off of our servers?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I was trying to help. We’ve been updating the wikis as much as we can and three-fifths of the work is gathering data that’s helpful to others.</p><p>Shower: We?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: It was a stupid hobby project. I was thinking of what everyone wanted the most and information seemed most critical. I had some guys I knew from way before and I thought I’d get everyone up to date and on the same page.</p><p>Shower: We often encourage hobby projects on PHO, though we cannot when resources are as tight as they are, and it would depend on scale and the amount of mess created. How easy is this to dismantle, and do I need to talk to anyone else?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Nobody else. It was me alone. I can fix it right now. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: How bad of a problem is this? Is there any leeway?</p><p>Shower: It’s interfering with others’ ability to access things. It might not seem like a problem here, because you’re close to the home node, but there are people on the periphery or far-flung regions and they’re going from satellite to ground to satellite to here, across several Earths. Shower: I think it’s best if you clean up as much of it as you can.</p><p>Shower: I think that since you’re a chat member in good standing, we’d be willing to let this slide with a warning if it can be promptly dealt with without any mess.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’ll have to reboot.</p><p>Shower: I’ll talk to you shortly.</p><p>You have left the conversation.</p><p>■</p><p>Connecting to “gChat.ParahumansOnline.Treefort_Lookout(6667)” (Attempt 32) Resolving Host Name Connecting… Connected.

No. They’re as dumb as dog farts. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Trigger phrases or phrases a set time after login. Different bots for different tasks. I’ve taken care of some of the most problematic.

It’s probably better than what you have.</p><p>Shower: Absolutely not. The security issues with that would be horrendous. It would allow snooping, spoofing- no.

Heart_Shaped_Pupil: What’s the question?</p><p>Mangled_Wings: I’ve been called Queen Dark twice and King Dark once.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: oh</p><p>Mangled_Wings: What does it mean? there are no dictionary websites that explain. I searched and I keep seeing the same paragraph.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: The paragraph is a paste. Queen Dark is a mean joke.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: they mock me?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’m sorry. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: You’ve gone quiet. You shouldn’t reply to them, you know. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: You’re still quiet. I don’t think the internet suits you, A. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I think you are beautiful and stunning and terrifying in person. In a good way, I think. Because you and I are on the same side. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Your voice doesn’t translate well. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I think you’re intimidating and you want to be intimidating on the internet and that doesn’t work at all. C is the intimidating one here. Somehow. He has that knack. That atmosphere. The skill.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: C is?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Funny, isn’t it?</p><p>Mangled_Wings: I think I hate the internet to the very center of my being.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: If you think about it, with powers and all, the center of your being could include the vast monster in another dimension that’s all hooked up into you. Passenger stuff. The center of mass could be in the middle of an alien god monster the size of a mountain or moon. I imagine it has the energy of a small star stored in it.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: This serves to illustrate the depth and energy of my hate for a setting where C might be more intimidating than I am.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I think I might agree with you on the hate thing. I want to meet face to face and hang out with S and you and maybe C and definitely Cap and R. I want that to work out. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: If that fails, I dunno.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: You don’t know? Mangled_Wings: I thought we had a deal.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I wasn’t sure if you were being serious.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: I am always serious. Mangled_Wings: We’ll handle this project. I aim to learn all I can. When or if it falls through, I will be an independent villain again. I aim to be a successful one.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Yeah.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: You’ll work for me. I’ll pay you, of course.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Hm.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: What?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: people run scared from me. it seems even non-people run from me, if I pay attention to what happened in the last hour. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: you aren’t running</p><p>Mangled_Wings: I don’t scare. Mangled_Wings: The world is filled with blithering idiots. More are only blither and more are silent idiots. You’re the exception. If you will work for me then I’ll damn well make good use of you. I’ll incentivize you to stay around.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: okay. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: you’re one of the cooler people I know, you know?</p><p>Mangled_Wings: See? Not a blithering idiot.</p></body></html>
