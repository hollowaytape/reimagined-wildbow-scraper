A_real: Hello. Thank you for the prompt response. I’m Sydney Curious_Cephalopod: I can guess what this is about A_real: According to our systems you have 32 individual accounts that you’re rotating through. Curious_Cephalopod: this is true A_real: Is it really needed to have one individual account for each day of the month and one for what I assume are holidays? Curious_Cephalopod: not what I was doing… Curious_Cephalopod: …but would be amusing with some reshuffling… Curious_Cephalopod: …assuming it was allowed… Curious_Cephalopod: …I’m guessing you will say it isn’t A_real: Duplicate accounts are of concern when it comes to tracking action across accounts Curious_Cephalopod: I see A_real: Isn’t that a hassle to manage 32 separate accounts? Curious_Cephalopod: I use a program to copy over settings A_real: I see. Curious_Cephalopod: I checked ToS. I don’t think any of this is against the rules A_real: But why do it? Curious_Cephalopod: security. I’m being surveilled… Curious_Cephalopod: …doing this lets me find out things A_real: Surveilled? Curious_Cephalopod: yes A_real: On PHO? Curious_Cephalopod: if they were stalking me elsewere and not here where it’s stalker central then they would be bad at what they do… Curious_Cephalopod: *elsewhere… Curious_Cephalopod: …and they aren’t A_real: If you’re trying to obfuscate, I have to question why you use a chain of names that connect to one another. Curious_Cephalopod: I’m not trying to hide. I’m trying to find out things. A_real: Do I need to notify authorities? If you’re joking, you need to tell me now. Curious_Cephalopod: that would cause more problems than it fixes… Curious_Cephalopod: …can we just say I’m joking and you agree and you can tell me what my punishment is… Curious_Cephalopod: …or what I need to do to fix this issue? A_real: I remain concerned. Curious_Cephalopod: how about this?… Curious_Cephalopod: …one second… Curious_Cephalopod: …there. It should be in my user images. A_real: Verification_For_Sydney.i A_real: I see it. I see. I’m assuming that in a matter of days, if you’re an avian of some sort… Curious_Cephalopod: Insect. Yes, I could supply a different verification image… Curious_Cephalopod: …so can we chalk this up to a peculiarity of mine? Powers weirdness? A_real: I’ll have to discuss with others. Curious_Cephalopod: alright A_real: I’m not wholly satisfied with this resolution. Either you were joking about something serious A_real: Or you’re being cavalier about something serious Curious_Cephalopod: Or I’m being watched and I’ve been under various kinds of observation for some time… Curious_Cephalopod: …and this isn’t that serious. Consider me a curious sort of multi-limbed invertebrate who would be happy to be left alone… Curious_Cephalopod: …except there’s always someone on the other side of the glass, tapping or taking notes. Ears pressed up against the walls. constant whispers… Curious_Cephalopod: …things moved in my habitat when I’m not looking… A_real: I think I have a sense of what you’re getting at. Curious_Cephalopod: …anohd thgis poartiocular obdserver is benign A_real: ? Curious_Cephalopod: software glitch. it doesn’t like interruptions A_real: I see. A_real: I’m putting you down as a verified cape, with some notes. I’m not going to make this available to anyone looking at your profile unless you want it. Curious_Cephalopod: I don’t A_real: I would like to link all of your 32 accounts together. This might take a few hours of fiddling on my end. It would only be info available to us and to you Curious_Cephalopod: and to any outside parties with access to my computer? A_real: I would avoid letting anyone have that access, if possible. Curious_Cephalopod: that will be fine. I will try and I’m fine with being linked up. A_real: Thank you for cooperating. Have a good day.</p><p>■</p><p>♦ Topic: Multiversal Travel Warnings In: Boards ► Gimel.US Khain (Guild Staff) Posted on August 22nd, Y1:</p><p>The Guild is presently established in three facilities outside of the city in Gimel.US, supporting authorities and serving as bodyguards and representatives for the onetime denizens of Earth Bet, as new areas are surveyed and contact with new cultures is made.</p><p>The process is exciting and interesting, and we report back as much as we are able, but it does have its hazards. After two recent incidents, we have decided to reach out to those we are familiar with, who are familiar with us. This forum is one of many places we’ll be striving to communicate needs and necessities.</p><p>Humans are explorers by nature. Our best count right now, excepting areas we cannot fully access, is that portals, devices, and tears between realities are currently allowing access to forty-seven Earths. Six of those Earths have been blocked off due to implicit threats or are fundamentally inaccessible. Two more have been closed off at the request of their denizens. Earth Aleph, which most Earth Bet residents are or were familiar with, has been blocked off as well.</p><p>Speak with authorities before making any trips to territories unknown. We don’t and can’t mount effective rescue operations if someone leaves and fails to return, but we have some ability to do so if and when authorities know where you’ve gone and you’ve stuck to the established route. People got lost or stranded in the wilderness on Earth in 2012, with all that world’s satellites. It can and will happen in new universes.</p><p>Do not travel to inhabited worlds. Absolutely do not make first contact. The first of the two incidents noted above was one where a family traveled across Earth Chamesh and happened across a settlement we were currently talking to. Much confusion and concern was had and we are still recovering.</p><p>The second is to please stick to charted territories. Exploring the uncharted is exciting, but if you aren’t equipped, you can come to harm, even if the world is uninhabited. One ex-Bet government (which shall remain unnamed) sent one expedition to Earth Achat. The Europe of that world was home to an invasive species, which grew as a tubular mold in dark, shadowed spaces, particularly in forest. Eating food exposed to the spores these molds created causes stomach cramps that progress to reflexive vomiting over the course of two to five days. The vomiting then lasts another two to five days, causing death by dehydration for any who don’t receive care.</p><p>Be aware: • Earth Gimel has been partially explored and checked by thinkers. There are no guarantees. Except for some rare indigenous colonies, it is unsettled. Gimel has five major points of settlement, with civilization finding its foothold around these points. The City, as of yet unnamed, is the primary US point of settlement and one of the primary waypoints. The City is a megalopolis with a commonly cited population of fifty million. A rough map (one month out of date) here. • Earth Mem has been partially settled by others from Bet. We are currently trying to establish some kind of communication and link. For novice explorers and those looking to settle new territories, we would encourage Gimel and Mem as largely safe options.</p><p>• Earth Bet has been deemed uninhabitable. Contrary to popular belief, radiation is not a major concern. However, many industrial sites were either destroyed or have weathered the last two years of neglect poorly, with chemicals leeching into groundwater and settling in valleys. Terrible numbers of deceased humans and other living species have led to other health concerns, particularly in previously heavily settled areas that received heavy damage. There will always be those who attempt to hold onto what we have lost, and many persist in trying to maintain some existence on Bet. However, new incidents arise on what seems to be a weekly or twice-weekly basis, with one in three having to do with powers, the powered, untended tinker technology, masters, and lingering threats. We may one day return to Bet, as some groups have fervently expressed a desire to do, but we have a great deal of work to do before this is possible. It may not happen in our generation or our children’s generation. Be aware that if you choose to return to Bet (and most authorities agree you have the fundamental right to do so) you may have to re-apply for entry and you will very likely be putting your well being in peril.</p><p>Speak with authorities before traveling to any other worlds. More information on multiversal threats.</p><p>More information to be disclosed about outside threats and cultures as we have it.</p><p>(Showing Page 108 of 270)</p><p>► Ohearn Replied on August 22nd, Y1: It’s about concentration. The fight happened near here. Scion attacked. We don’t know why but it might have had to do with the Slaughterhouse Nine, going by the news reports and what some have said. It might have had to do with the Simurgh. It could have been something else altogether. But things wrapped up near here. People came through and most of us picked two worlds to settle in, with Gimel as the big one.</p><p>But a lot of people fought. A lot of capes. Many were foreign. The fight ended… and then? We are doing or did our best to get them home, but not all want to go home. Or Scion didn’t leave them a home to go back to. A lot of them have gathered into like groups. That’s where we get the weird corner-world settlements.</p><p>► Venturain Replied on August 22nd, Y1: the corner world places aren’t inherently bad tho, right? we (my family) just got into the city one month ago. right away pressure pressure. we can move into city but standardized rent and we need to earn wage and we may be asked to move. best option is to move to city periphery and farm. they say they will give us tools and resources to get started but good spots are taken or very far away and farming isn’t easy</p><p>corner worlds are closer in a way. go to noon, go to wherever from there.</p><p>if we aren’t reconstruction or farming we aren’t wanted. so why become cogs in the city’s machine? we can strike off on our own. minor risk but total freedom</p><p>► Slayer of Isaac Replied on August 22nd, Y1: @ Venturain – that was our mindset. My family tried it. We had the bad fortune of settling at one corner settlement. Two points removed. We got off to an okay start. Shelter up, food out, basic needs covered. Regular trips to the city to supply up and cover more advanced needs.</p><p>Winter of Year Zero caught us off guard. We thought we were ahead of what we needed but staying warm gets hard and getting warm means chopping wood, which means physical effort, which means needing more food.</p><p>I was handling most trips into the city. I was worn out and got real sick. My brother handled one trip, asked for help, came back with capes.</p><p>They helped, yeah. Then they took over. It was bad. You can find my photo diary on my user page.</p><p>My brother went out and asked for help again. The second time around, the capes were willing to fix the problem and leave. Most of us moved back to the city. Bitter feelings.</p><p>► Athonic Replied on August 22nd, Y1: @ Venturain – there’s need for other work. doctors. teachers. there’s a need for people that are good at finding and vetting the skilled labor. finding qualified doctors and getting them to hospitals, finding teachers and helping to establish new schools.</p><p>organization is the hardest part.</p><p>many injured, many with special needs. i’m in robotics and prosthetics and there’s no shortage of need. my friend is a radiologist and he’s in high demand.</p><p>► Lex_Dogbell Replied on August 22nd, Y1: Many of those things require education. Letters started arriving yesterday. Rejected, rejected, rejected. No education. My friends are saying government is holding off on setting up schools because there is so much need for physical labor, industry, agriculture.</p><p>► mlekk (was mlekk) Replied on August 22nd, Y1: [User was banned for this post, badge changed]</p><p>► Ferris (Cape Dad) Replied on August 22nd, Y1: Right now we don’t seem to have many threats at home. Things are quiet. The monsters are out there if they’re even alive. Sleeper is still in Zayin and seems contained there. The Birdcage was abandoned and we don’t know if the residents were left to starve. Few of the real monsters seem to be here. The dictators don’t have the infrastructure. Our best capes are off doing good work and seeing what’s out there. Our capes at home are calm and quiet. I’m okay with that.</p><p>► Fishmon Replied on August 22nd, Y1: Not all of the dictators. Not every place was ruined. There are monsters out there who I will not name out of fear for my safety. They were kept in check back on Bet and nothing holds them back now that much of the world has evacuated. The weather may be bad there but they may not have had industry or other problems to taint things. Things are looking up here but there I think it may be hellish for the citizens. Who can help them? Is difficult. If calamity comes in plague or bugs or rats then the people suffer, but dictators will not let them escape. I make calls every day.</p><p>► Moor (Guild) Replied on August 22nd, Y1: I’m going to reach out to you by direct message, Fishmon. Tell me what you can.</p><p>End of Page. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 … 107, 108, 109 … 268, 269, 270</p><p>■</p><p>♦ Joined Group Conversation: Cap, Heart_Shaped_Pupil, of5, Mangled_Wings:</p><p>Cap: I don’t know that much</p><p>Mangled_Wings: You know some. You were a corporate hero.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Share. Don’t be shy. 😉</p><p>Cap: I was a man on the ground in a flashy costume. I was told to do things and I did them. my mental energy went toward figuring out what I would do when I had discretion. Cap: Some of it.</p><p>of5: I know what you mean about mental energy.</p><p>Cap: right? time management is a nightmare even without complications. add family, team drama, having to look good for the cameras and magazines and I wasn’t exactly thinking about upper management. I listened to the boss and I winked at the intern with the cute butt sometimes. Cap: I didn’t dwell on the ins and outs. so if you want me to supply info on the ins and outs of how the corporate capes work as a business, I can’t. I don’t even want to dwell on it. those were bad times for me. there’s a reason I left it behind.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: I hope you can share what you do know at some point.</p><p>Cap: Of course.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Spending a lot of mental energy lately, R?</p><p>of5: I might have to go to ground. I may not be able to travel to the next town to use library hookup until our next meeting. I have some indications that some people are after me. More than they were the day before yesterday.</p><p>Cap: do you need me to come? My brother and I can visit, hang out, offer you some backup. I might not remember much about the nuances of the corp team, but I have pride in my ability in a scrap</p><p>of5: I appreciate that.</p><p>Cap: it could be fun. you’re the closest thing I have to a best friend atm, so we might as well hang at some point.</p><p>of5: Oof. Yes. We get along best, out of the group. It would be good in other times, maybe. But I don’t know what vectors they can use to attack or track me. This whole thing is a mess.</p><p>Cap: I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with the cluster-trigger clusterfuck</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Amen.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: Agreed.</p><p>of5: Easiest if I just drop off the radar for a bit. We can touch base later. I might check in to see if S showed and we can go from there. Otherwise I see you in a few days.</p><p>Cap: help is available if you need it.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: i was going to say. i’d ♥love♥ to be of help</p><p>of5: I’m safe where I am for now. in a sense.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: With family?</p><p>of5: Mostly. Obviously not when I’m here. Hard to strike a balance. It’s not good times.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: My sympathies.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: !</p><p>of5: I… really appreciate that, a.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: !!</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: please, K. Let it be.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Ok. 🙂</p><p>Cap: C. good to see you stepping out of the shadows. Cap: I wondered if you would speak up</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: the shadows are where it’s comfortable and safe.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: The shadows are where the real monsters lurk</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: that too, A… Curious_Cephalopod: …that too.</p><p>Cap: why are you curious, out of curiosity?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Doing research?</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: curious in the british sense… Curious_Cephalopod: …odd, quirky, eccentric… Curious_Cephalopod: …I was doing research, as a matter of fact.</p><p>Mangled_Wings: On?</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: figuring out the landscape. looking at maps. where we want to set up.</p><p>Cap: and?</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: and it feels like the A-listers are busy. everyone else is in the shadows… Curious_Cephalopod: …waiting for someone else to break the peace and take the hate when they get blamed… Curious_Cephalopod: …the problem is we’re so geographically spread out. even if we discount R.</p><p>of5: I’m aiming to move into the city. There are complications</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: your friend</p><p>of5: a lot of things.</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: the megalopolis makes for bad logistics.</p><p>Cap: I do hope you’ll step out of those shadows more, c. Cap: it’s been interesting talking to you online and seeing how talkative you are here. Cap: I like what you contribute when you speak up</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: that’s me being an introvert.</p><p>Cap: that’s fixable</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: I think you badly underestimate my introversion, T…</p><p>of5: Okay, hold on.</p><p>Cap: holding on</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: [error]!

I’m psyched because this all feels positive.</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: maybe</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: On the topic of positivity…</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: ? Did you disconnect?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: So I was thinking we should meet in the city. You were talking about logistics and I was thinking about where eveyrone was. you’re closest to me and we’re the same age I think? So I was thinking we could meet and talk strategy over fast food. We could even do something after and build team bonds and things like that. Maybe a movie or arcade. Whatever you want to do. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: No pressure. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Sorry. I wrote and rewrote that three times</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: You mean a date?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I didn’t say a date.</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: But you mean a date.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Maybe. Sure. Springtime of youth and all that pizazz. Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Or pre-springtime. Tweentime of spring? The thawing of the slush doesn’t have the same conotations</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: I think there are about a hundred different reasons why I should say no to that. actually… Curious_Cephalopod: …make that two hundred. I legitimately think I could name two hundred reasons why that’s a terrible idea.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Really? Two hundred?</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: The more I think of it, the more reasons I come up with… Curious_Cephalopod: …no, K.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Can I ask why?</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: because you’re you and I’m me… Curious_Cephalopod: …no and don’t ask again.</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Ok. 🙂 Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Can I ask another question?</p><p>Curious_Cephalopod: will I regret saying yes?</p><p>Heart_Shaped_Pupil: When you were talking to Ms. Sydney earlier Heart_Shaped_Pupil: You hinted at having a reason for the changing nicks.
