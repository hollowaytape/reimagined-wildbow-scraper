The lists are formed by way of interview and laboratory studies with each institution using universally standardized forms in addition to supplementary material. Each of these three institutions have stated an express or strongly-implied desire to understand and predict expressions of power and tie these expressions to the inciting incidents. However, a longstanding problem in this process is that powers expressed, inciting incidents, and contextual factors can be dramatically different across individual cases. While some common themes can be drawn out, derived results are traditionally very big-picture. It is only recently that databases have begun to include sufficient numbers of special-case triggers that allow more focused study of how powers are expressed. We identified cluster powers, serial powers, matched powers, and Nth-generation powers as the special cases to focus on in more focused examination of how power instances can be mapped and we posit a â€˜Hinge Pointâ€™ illustration of power expression and theory.</p><p>[Definitions] â€¢ Cluster powers are defined as powers wherein multiple inciting incidents occur either simultaneously or within a minute of one another. Such parahumans will have a collection of smaller powers related to the others. â€¢ Serial powers are defined as cases where an individual or multiple individuals in longstanding proximity to a parahuman will develop powersâ€¦</p><p>[Click to read full article]</p><p>(5 of 280 replies match search criteria)</p><p>â–º of5 Replied on August 20th, Y1: Link is broken.</p><p>â–º WMD377 (PRT Science Admin) Replied on August 20th, Y1: Yes.

Posted with permission. Cleaned up where I could</p><p>Overview: What are clusters? Other names are mosaic p. expression, grabbag, multi Effect on resulting power Why important & Importance to study. Case studies Greater effects, things to keep in mind</p><p>Pt. 1: What are clusters? 2-6 people trigger at same time or very close together. Each gets a suite of powers. Person A gets Person A primary power and fragment of B, C, D, E, F. Person B gets Person B primary power and fragment A, C, D, etc.</p><p>Pt 2: Effect on resulting power Term secondary expressions. Weaker or subtle power. Can be conditional. Primary powers may be weaker than if they had triggered alone? Powers inspired by others but not identical. Relation may be tertiary. Example given firebreath -> fire something or something breath Prof stresses this is very basic example Term for staying element is hinge (old) or dominant (current). Relates to 1998 article.</p><p>Pt 3: Why important & importance to study Suggests powers arenâ€™t 100% predetermined. Certain elements are highlighted or made dominant. We can extrapolate from studies like this & serial triggers to work out key elements of existing triggers. What changes & why = what factors are important in standalone non-special trigger?</p><p>Case Studies: two cases & how we look at them Two case studies. Interview, self-reporting, examination</p><p>Case Study #1: Sunder Bros Take note for future week: matched powers. We come back to this. Brother #1 â€“ Destruction caused to objects ripples out indefinitely, stopping at clear demarcations (images included in lecture notes). Weapon extension without limit (except convenience) Brother #2 â€“ Weapon sweep extension â€“ some range extension â€“ wider arcs, shockwaves left/right of swing. Stomp to destroy ground in immediate area.</p><p>Class pauses, prof asks & responds to input re: dominant factors in each power.</p><p>Cute girl in red top finally comes up with answer that satisfies Spinky. Destruction & weapon attack augmentation dominant/staying/hinge factors. Question of range vs. breadth between brothers. Not very lopsided in power difference b/w primary & secondary power. Spinkyâ€™s stress on not.</p><p>We get some slides of brotherâ€™s recreation of trigger circumstance. Distance from threat. Prof Spinky highlights personality traits brothers used on forms they filled out. All as reasoning for different power expressions.</p><p>Case Study #2: Fowl & Fair (foreign capes, names that follow are badly translated) Oxfair â€“ Physical augmentation; size, strength, speed, agility (<- primary), deafening roar, transfer harm from falls/some impacts to nearby others, pain resistance/faster healing Ramfair â€“ Emotion affecting chant, size increase, some ability to heal very recent damage of others listening to chant/that touching, gather strength/concentrate -> giant leaps Foulcock (yes, the class laughed) â€“ Flight with build-up of speed over time, speed is transferred to touched others, interrupting flight to deliver high-impact blows. Increased agility, deafening shriek, fast recovery of smaller wounds (scratches yes, no recovery of larger wounds). Foulpig â€“ Personal biokinesis, swell into flesh bubble with fast recovery/personal mutations if not â€˜poppedâ€™ in time. Some strength & size increase, but slower while grown. Ability to â€˜rollâ€™ with incoming impacts (mover expression? Turns into boulder). Guttural noise (flatulence? Burps?) to interrupt thought processes â€“ turn off othersâ€™ brains momentarily.</p><p>Discussion of dynamic. Fair & foul on opposite sides post-trigger. Only fair provided answers & allowed power testing, rest has to be inferred. Handouts.</p><p>Some discussion of trigger event (see slides for images), some discussion of resulting â€˜packageâ€™. Powers for each individual distinct but play off each other in semi-complementary way. Reflective of personality? Or â€˜guiding handâ€™ principle?</p><p>Pt. 4: Greater effects & things to keep in mind â€“ things touched on in homework reading: Kill / Kiss â€“ more on this in parahuman psychology class in a few weeks Personality Bleed â€“ personality traits bleed over from 1 individual to other? Messy Higher incidences of paranoia, confrontation, aggression, PTSD. Less bounce back? Higher rate of death post-trigger. Kill / kiss again. Graph Prof Spinky stresses emotional states may play into the above. Triggers that are sufficient to draw in multiple individuals are worse than average. Canâ€™t jump 2 conclusions. Correlation =/= causation.</p><p>(2 of 1140 replies match search criteria)</p><p>â–º of5 Replied on August 20th, Y1: Lecture slides & graph missing.</p><p>â–º DigaWell Replied on August 20th, Y1: ty again of5. nothing we can do about that one</p><p>End of Page 1.

Clusters have a 40% chance of one member murdering another, rising to a 50% chance when including attempted murder, 25% chance of a partnership forming, and a 10% incidence of partnership and murder coinciding. The term partnership is used for romantic pairings in instances where sexuality and gender allow, and close friendship or formed teams with members in other cases. In some (10% of) cases of close partnerships forming, the romantic pairing occurred despite oneâ€™s typical sexuality. The relationship entanglement study looks at existing cases and clusters to investigate why.</p><p>The most dramatic case in recent memory is the StÃ¡j, also known as the Stable, or the Foul and the Fair.

Rest of them wouldnâ€™t be searching online like you are. 17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I found two members of the shipwreck group. They might be doing what youâ€™re doing with the searching but they know the code. Theyâ€™re friends of mine. Third member of that group is dead. 17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The lecture hall: if you were one of them, you wouldnâ€™t be so naive. 17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: That leaves three options. The Kansas Cornfield massacre: 3 dead, 1 alive with no reason to care about multis. He ate the rest of his cluster. of5: Ate? 17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The book fair.

The first of the capes may have been a thinker, likely the same that shot down our flier.

She was a woman with a fanged mask covering her lower face, and a form-fitting dress with a slit up the side of one leg. She displayed a mover power [fourth term] with the ability to run on walls. She produced an emotion-affecting [third term] roar, which broke the ranks of one of the cooperating teams, and had metal claws [second term] which looked to be of tinker make. These claws may have been what enabled her to tear [First term not met, but within allowance] down doors and other barricades with the ease she did.
